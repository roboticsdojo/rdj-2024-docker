# RDJ-2024 Docker Image (v2.0.0)

## Using the Convenience Script

This script (`start-rdj-2024.sh`) simplifies the process of pulling, creating, and running ROS2 Docker containers on both Raspberry Pi (ARM64) and PC (AMD64) platforms.

### Prerequisites

1. Docker installed on your system -> [Install Docker Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. User added to the Docker group to run Docker commands without sudo -> [Post-Install Steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)
3. X11 or Wayland display server running on the host system

### Usage

1. Download the script `start-rdj-2024.sh` into your desired directory.

2. Make the script executable (Linux Terminal):
   ```bash
   chmod +x start-rdj-2024.sh
   ```

3. Run the script (Linux Terminal):
   ```bash
   ./start-rdj-2024.sh
   ```

### What the Script Does

1. Removes any existing containers named `rdj-2024` to ensure a fresh start.
2. Pulls the latest version of the RDJ-2024 Docker image.
3. Checks if you're running on a Raspberry Pi or a PC.
4. Creates and runs a new container with the appropriate display forwarding setup (X11 or Wayland).

### Features

- **Automatic Platform Detection**: Automatically detects whether you're on a Raspberry Pi or PC and uses the appropriate Docker image and settings.
- **Display Forwarding**: Sets up X11 or Wayland display forwarding, allowing GUI applications to run inside the Docker container and display on the host system.
- **Fresh Environment**: Always creates a new container, ensuring a clean and up-to-date environment for each session.
- **Latest Image Pull**: Always pulls the latest version of the Docker image before running, ensuring you have the most up-to-date environment.
- **VNC Server**: Includes a pre-configured VNC server for remote GUI access.

## New in v2.0.0

- **VNC Server Integration**: Remote GUI access with Xfce4 desktop environment and TightVNC server.
- **Enhanced Linux Toolkit**: Added essential development tools including nano, gedit, X11 apps, and Mesa utilities.
- **Updated ROS2 Base**: Latest ROS Humble distribution with improved compatibility and performance.
- **Navigation Upgrades**: Integrated Navigation2 stack and Turtlebot3 packages.
- **Gazebo Integration**: Improved support for robotics simulation with ROS-Gazebo packages.

## Notes

- The script uses the image `codewithlennylen/rdj-2024:latest`. You can view it on Docker Hub by clicking [here.](https://hub.docker.com/r/codewithlennylen/rdj-2024)
- If you need to use a different image or tag, modify the `IMAGE_NAME` variable at the top of the script.
- The script creates a container named `rdj-2024`. If you need to use a different name, modify the `CONTAINER_NAME` variable.
- Each time you run the script, it will remove any existing containers with the same name and create a new one. This ensures you always start with a fresh environment.
- To connect to the VNC server, use a VNC client and connect to `localhost:5901` (password: `rdj-2024`).

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission issues, ensure your user is part of the Docker group:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  ```
  Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.
- For X11 display issues on PC, try running `xhost +local:docker` before running the script.
- If the script fails to detect your display server correctly, you can manually modify the script to use the correct method (X11 or Wayland).
- If you experience issues with the VNC server, ensure no other VNC sessions are running on the same port.

## Submitting Issues

If you encounter any problems or have suggestions for improvements, we encourage you to submit an issue. Here's how to do it effectively:
